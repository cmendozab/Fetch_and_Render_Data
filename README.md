# Description: 
> Short project description. 

This is a simple project with a search input and button to search for results of movies or series from OMDb database using its API.

# Installation: 
> There is nothing to install in here.

If you want to test this project you will have to create a new Node.js App. Run it and modify the default files to include the code from App.js in this repository.

# Usage: 
> This project has a very simple user interface.

You will require to start a new npm session for this project after creating the Node.js project folder and adding the changes to the App.js file as required. Follow the instructions shown inside the App.js file in this repository for more information. All that is required is to get a new API Key from OMDb and use it inside App.js file from this repository.

Once you get the API Key and provided that you have already adapted the App.js with the code from this project (including your own API Key), then you can try the result in a local browser on your computer (npm start).
